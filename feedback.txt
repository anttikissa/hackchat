+ Clean design [some people do get it]

+ Great execution of the idea!

+ I also like the URL updating. Makes it easy to share a chat room, and like the
instructions say, save your chat room favorites.

+ I like the openness of irc, but does it rhave to stay 100% zero-formatted
text?

+ like the bookmarking

+ with full text search, a simple api and integration w/ github + CI, it could
be a powerful tool for dev teams

? [felt solid but] no feature that made me go wow, though

+ I like the sheer simplicity

- Could not get /nick to work for me at start however.

- [I like it, but] it would have to be 100% reliable. got a lot of "Failed to
reconnect" errors

- I was able to see messages of channels that I was not on [might have been
confusion with which channels he was on]
 
? Would like private chats (for a company)

? It would be great if you can make it extensible through being able to hook
into webservices, such as github, buildsystems, twitter searches, etc. If this
was possible this would be an environment which I would consider to use

? history / logs would be great

? themes :)

? Would like to join freenode IRC channels

? Mobile? How do keyboard shortcuts work?
