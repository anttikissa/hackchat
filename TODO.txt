# Items to do

Make sure that the list of channels stays up-to-date.

Make scrolling work.

Private messages.

"1 people on #foo"

/join foo - you're already on that channel!
    Should just add channel to the current connection/socket.

    And it shouldn't be the default.

/list

Topics

Logs...

The big channel-connection association thing - what does it mean to be on a
channel?

/whois

Add timestamps to output

Any unique prefix of a command should work

Nick collisions
    Actually, not at all important!

# To do... later

Why is reconnect broken?
    Fixed with a inglorious socket.io hack - get back to this later.
