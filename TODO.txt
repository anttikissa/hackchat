+ Clean design [some people do get it]

+ Great execution of the idea!

+ I also like the URL updating. Makes it easy to share a chat room, and like the
instructions say, save your chat room favorites.

+ I like the openness of irc, but does it rhave to stay 100% zero-formatted
text?

+ like the bookmarking

+ with full text search, a simple api and integration w/ github + CI, it could
be a powerful tool for dev teams

? [felt solid but] no feature that made me go wow, though

+ I like the sheer simplicity

- Could not get /nick to work for me at start however.

- [I like it, but] it would have to be 100% reliable. got a lot of "Failed to
reconnect" errors

- I was able to see messages of channels that I was not on [might have been
confusion with which channels he was on]
 
? Would like private chats (for a company)

? It would be great if you can make it extensible through being able to hook
into webservices, such as github, buildsystems, twitter searches, etc. If this
was possible this would be an environment which I would consider to use

? history / logs would be great

? themes :)

? Would like to join freenode IRC channels

? Mobile? How do keyboard shortcuts work?



# Items to do

Immediately reconnect when user issues a command.

Make sure that messages directed to an user are sent even though the user is
disconnected for some reason.  Have User have a queue of unsent messages (which
are then, discarded, if they pile up uncollected?)?

Implement something like "*** zum is on channels: #foo #bar #zot" that is sent
to client when socket is connected, and have the client update its channel
status from there.  This will also come as part of a `/whois` result.

Reorganize code.
    Mostly done, still need to delete the old stuff once it gets reimplemented.

See what ircII does better when joining a channel. (Listing the participants,
how does it look?)

Topics

Private messages.

"1 people on #foo" -> 1 person

/join foo - you're already on that channel!
    Should just add channel to the current connection/socket.

    And it shouldn't be the default.

Logs...

/whois

Any unique prefix of a command should work

Nick collisions
    Actually, not at all important!

# To do... later

Why is reconnect broken?
    Fixed with a inglorious socket.io hack - get back to this later.
