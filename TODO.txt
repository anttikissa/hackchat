# Items to do

Reimplement old stuff.
    /leave
    ... what else?

Immediately reconnect when user issues a command.
    socket.io magic?

Make sure that messages directed to an user are sent even though the user is
disconnected for some reason.  Have User have a queue of unsent messages (which
are then, discarded, if they pile up uncollected?)?

Implement something like "*** zum is on channels: #foo #bar #zot" that is sent
to client when socket is connected, and have the client update its channel
status from there.  This will also come as part of a `/whois` result.

Reorganize code.
    Mostly done, still need to delete the old stuff once it gets reimplemented.

See what ircII does better when joining a channel. (Listing the participants,
how does it look?)

Topics

Private messages.

"1 people on #foo" -> 1 person

/join foo - you're already on that channel!
    Should just add channel to the current connection/socket.

    And it shouldn't be the default.

Logs...

/whois

Any unique prefix of a command should work

Nick collisions
    Actually, not at all important!

# To do... later

Why is reconnect broken?
    Fixed with a inglorious socket.io hack - get back to this later.
